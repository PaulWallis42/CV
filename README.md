## Paul Wallis

I am an enthusiastic and energetic individual who recently decided to make a BIG career change and become a coder.
Having done some online research and spoken to people within the industry I decided that coding was a field that I would like to get involved with due to it being challenging, forever evolving and is a field full of opportunities.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (March 2015 - June 2015)
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/home) is a highly selective 12 week full-time course where the ethos is based on developing code through Test Driven Development.  The course taught me the concepts of pair programming, TDD, OOP, BDD, SOLID, MVC and Agile coding. I was immersed in several different programming languages and technologies a few of which I have outlined below:

Technology | Language/Framework/Tool
-----------|------------------------
**Front End** | HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Angular.js
**Back End** | Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js
**Databases & ORMs** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL, ActiveRecord, Data Mapper
**Testing** | RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Cucumber, Karma, Protractor
**Other** | APIs, Git/Github, Gems, AJAX, Json, REST

# Projects from my time at Makers Academy

- [Ignite](https://github.com/PaulWallis42/final_project_2)  
  Ignite was the final project of the course that had to be completed from scratch in two weeks.  I was one in a team of four that developed and deployed [Ignite on Heroku](https://igniteit.herokuapp.com) this fully functioning crowd funding application for social and charitable projects.  The app allows users to find projects based on loaction or type, donate money to them and follow blogs and videos of projects.  Project leaders can upload projects and set a funding target and a target deadline amongst other things.  Technologies used included: Rails, Postgres, JavaScript, Bootstrap, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, CSS, JQuery and several Ruby Gems. 

- [Footy Finder](https://github.com/PaulWallis42/footy-finder)  
  Footy Finder was a two day mini project where we had to create a MVP as a team of six people.  The basic concept of the challenge was to build an application that a user who wished to find a game of social football to play can log on to the Footy Finder app and find games locally to them and register to play in them.  

- [Instagram](https://github.com/PaulWallis42/instagram-challenge)  
  The Instagram challenge was a solo project that had to be completed in two days and the aim of the project was to re-create Instagram from scratch.  To create this CRUD application I used Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Active Record CSS and HTML amongst other technologies.
