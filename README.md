## Paul Wallis

I am an enthusiastic and energetic individual who recently decided to make a BIG career change and become a coder.
Having done some online research and spoken to people within the industry I decided that coding was a field that I would like to get involved with due to it being challenging, forever evolving and is a field full of opportunities.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (March 2015 - June 2015)
Makers Academy http://www.makersacademy.com/home is a highly selective 12 week full-time course where the ethos is based on developing code through Test Driven Development.  The course taught me the concepts of pair programming, TDD, OOP, BDD, SOLID, MVC and Agile coding. I was immersed in several different programming languages and technologies a few of which I have outlined below:

Technology | Language/Framework/Tool
-----------|------------------------
**Front End** | HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Angular.js
**Back End** | Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js
**Databases & ORMs** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL, ActiveRecord, Data Mapper
**Testing** | RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Cucumber, Karma, Protractor
**Other** | APIs, Git/Github, Gems, AJAX, Json, REST
